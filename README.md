# Laravel + Storyblok Integration Demo

This repository is a hands-on demonstration of integrating **Storyblok**, a headless CMS, into a modern **Laravel** application.

Built for **Laracon US 2025** in Denver, this project is aimed at Laravel developers who are exploring headless CMS workflows and want to evaluate Storyblok in a real-world context. It focuses on clean architecture, flexible content modeling, and bridging the gap between structured content and Laravel’s powerful server-side rendering capabilities.

## What This Project Covers

- Efficient integration with the Storyblok Content Delivery API using the Storyblok Content Delivery API Client
- Dynamic rendering of Storyblok content via Blade/Livewire components
- Support for the Storyblok Visual Editor for a reactive preview
- Practical content modeling patterns for Laravel projects
- Scalable structure for larger, component-driven applications

If you’re already comfortable with Laravel and are curious about how Storyblok can fit into your stack, this repo provides a clear, opinionated starting point.
